# SAS_DataViz
This project applies the PROC SGMAP to construct the maps in SAS. This paper will discuss three
different map types using SGMAP: “OpenStreetMap”, “ERSI map” and “chord map”. Choropleth
maps are produced by using a combination of a map data set and a response data set. A map data
set contains the information needed to draw map boundaries. A response data set contains the
information that is to be displayed on the map such as crime location. In addition to x-y coordinates
which are ‘Latitude’, and ‘Longitude’, map data sets also contain an identification variable by
which we have identified San Francisco. However, for the “OpenStreetMap” and“ERSI map”, we
don’t need any additional map data set
